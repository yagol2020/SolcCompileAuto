# Solc Compile Auto Project

This project will help you automatically distinguish between solC versions of SOL files. When you have a large number of
SOL files that need to be compiled (for example, during testing). You can use this project, which will automatically
switch `solc` versions and automatically compile to separate folders(using `solc-select`). You can also configure the
compilation options for `solc`.
